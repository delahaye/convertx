### License

Almost all files of it are licenced to the LGPL. See the docs-directory for a copy of the license. Some parts of the
extension needed to perform import runs are under a commercial license. Those files are marked so in their file
header and normally riside in the directory TL_ROOT/system/modules/convertx/classes/Delahaye/ConvertX. See the
docs-directory of the main extension for details about the license.

This way of licensing allows a professional development of the extension as well as your ability to modify it the way
you need it for your project.
